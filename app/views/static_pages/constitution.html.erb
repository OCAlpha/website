<h2>Article 2</h2>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <h4>Section 1</h4>
      <p>Each member should look upon his membership in Alpha Gamma Omega as a whole-hearted allegiance to the principles set forth in this constitution.</p>
    <h4>Section 2</h4>
      <p>The purpose of Alpha Gamma Omega is to instill in her members:
      <dl>
        <dt>An Obligation to God</dt>
          <dd>We are composed of dedicated men that bring each other closer to God through Christ and grow with each other in fellowship.</dd>
        <dt>An Obligation to Club Spirit and Brotherhood</dt>
          <dd>We strive to give her members a sense of duty and obligation to the club's activities and to have incredibly strong, fierce sense of spirit to the club.</dd>
        <dt>An Obligation to Excellence</dt>
          <dd>We strive not to obtain trophies, rather for excellence in all we do.</dd>
      </dl>
      </p>
    <h4>Section 3</h4>
      <p>Alpha Gamma Omega places itself under the authority of the Vice President for Student Development.</p>
<h2>Article 3</h2>
  <h3>Membership and Dues</h3>    
    <h4>Section 1</h4>
      <p>All members of Alpha Gamma Omega shall be men enrolled at Oklahoma Christian University taking at least five hours. Members must maintain the guidelines for membership as set forth by the Inter-Club Council (hereafter noted as I.C.C.). </p>
    <h4>Section 2</h4>
      <p>The number of members shall not exceed the limits set forth by the I.C.C. </p>
    <h4>Section 3</h4>
      <p>The members shall be granted membership by club sign-up and shall be voted in by the current members without discrimination with respect to race, creed, or national origin. </p>
    <h4>Section 4</h4>
      <p>The voting procedure shall commence as follows: Those who feel that an individual has shown enough potential for entering Alpha should vote "Yes" on that individual by checking the box, while those who do not feel the individual should represent Alpha should vote "No" by leaving it blank.  There are no non-votes.  The President, Vice President, and Chaplain are in charge of counting the votes.  In the event of a tie, the President, Vice President, and Chaplain use their votes to decide. This will only take into account members that are eligible to vote according to rush policies, and those that have submitted ballots. Absentee ballots must be received by Rush Director or President BEFORE voting meeting.
      <aside>Note: During every voting meeting, it is important to stress the two-sided coin that is Club Membership.  Brotherly Unity does not require uniformity-therefore, no one should be excluded on the basis of annoying quirks or other trivial matters.  However, if an individual's behavior and attitude is not befitting the reputation of an Alpha Knight, they should not be allowed to represent Alpha as a member.</aside>
      </p>
    <h4>Section 5</h4>
      <p>Should any members have a good reason that someone should or should not get into club but believes the information is too private to share with all of club, that member is to present the case to the President(within an hour after voting), who will check and see if their opinion is opposite of the vote.  If it is, the President and Vice President must unanimously decide if a case is worth pursuing.  In the case that it is to be pursued, the matter is presented to the officers immediately and privately.   An all but 2 vote is needed from the officers to change the vote.
      Note: This is not something to be taken lightly, club votes should in all but very rare cases be the official vote.  This, however, does help cases with information too sensitive to be shared with all of club.
      </p>
    <h4>Section 6</h4>
      <p>The minimal rush voting policies are for members to attend at least 3 rush events in the Fall semester and at least 2 rush events in the Spring semester. These policies are subject to the rush director's verification and/or change each semester.</p>
    <h4>Section 7</h4>
      <p>Once members are voted in, the club shall follow the guidelines set forth by the I.C.C. regarding pledging and shall not in any way violate the Hazing Law set forth by the state of Oklahoma. </p>
    <h4>Section 8</h4>
      <p>Each member shall pay dues of an amount set forth by the current officers at the beginning of the fall school term. </p>
